     * @brief Interface for log sinks that handle log output
     * 
     * Log sinks receive LogEntry objects and output them to their designated
     * destination. Each sink can implement its own formatting, filtering,
     * and delivery mechanisms.
     * 
     * Common sink implementations:
     * - Console: Output to stdout/stderr with optional color
     * - File: Persistent storage with rotation support
     * - Network: Remote logging servers
     * - Database: Structured storage for analysis
     * - Memory: In-memory ring buffer
     * 
     * Multiple sinks can operate independently with different configurations,
     * allowing flexible log routing based on severity or category.

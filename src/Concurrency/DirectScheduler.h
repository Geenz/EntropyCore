/**
 * @brief The "just give me work!" scheduler - absolute minimum overhead.
 * 
 * This is the scheduler equivalent of a greedy algorithm. It scans from the 
 * beginning and grabs the first group with work. No fancy logic, no state,
 * no optimization. Just pure, simple work-finding.
 * 
 * This scheduler was created to isolate scheduling logic from other system
 * overheads in benchmarking scenarios.
 * 
 * The Good:
 * - No state means no memory allocation
 * - Dead simple to understand and debug
 * - First groups get priority (which might be what you want)
 * 
 * The Bad:
 * - Terrible work distribution - first groups get hammered
 * - No load balancing whatsoever
 * - Later groups might starve if early groups always have work
 * - All threads pile onto the same groups
 * 
 * When to use this:
 * - Benchmarking to establish absolute minimum overhead
 * - Debugging to eliminate scheduler as a variable
 * - When you have only one or two groups anyway
 * - Testing worst-case contention scenarios
 * 
 * When NOT to use this:
 * - Production systems (seriously, don't)
 * - Multiple groups that need fair execution
 * - Any time you care about performance beyond raw overhead
 * 
 * @code
 * // Only use this for testing!
 * auto scheduler = std::make_unique<DirectScheduler>(config);
 * // Now all threads will pile onto group[0] if it has work
 * @endcode

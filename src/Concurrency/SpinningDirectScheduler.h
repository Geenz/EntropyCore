/**
 * @brief CPU-intensive scheduler that eliminates sleep/wake overhead for benchmarking
 * 
 * SpinningDirectScheduler extends the DirectScheduler concept by eliminating all thread
 * sleep operations. While DirectScheduler allows threads to sleep when no work is available,
 * this implementation maintains continuous CPU activity through spinning, even when work
 * queues are empty.
 * 
 * Purpose: This scheduler specifically addresses the benchmarking requirement to measure
 * and isolate thread sleep/wake overhead by providing a comparison baseline where such
 * overhead is completely eliminated.
 * 
 * Characteristics:
 * - CPU usage when idle: 100% per thread
 * - No thread sleep/wake cycles
 * - Threads remain active continuously
 * 
 * Recommended use cases:
 * - Diagnosing impact of OS thread scheduling
 * - Measuring sleep/wake cycle overhead in workloads
 * - Testing scenarios requiring minimal latency
 * - Comparative benchmarking against DirectScheduler
 * 
 * Not recommended for:
 * - Production systems (excessive CPU consumption)
 * - Battery-powered devices (rapid power drain)
 * - Shared computing environments (resource monopolization)
 * - Any scenario requiring power efficiency
 * 
 * Benchmarking insight: Comparing this scheduler against DirectScheduler reveals OS-specific
 * thread wake latencies, which vary significantly by operating system and system load.
 * 
 * @code
 * // Use this to compare against DirectScheduler
 * auto directScheduler = std::make_unique<DirectScheduler>(config);
 * WorkService directService(config, std::move(directScheduler));
 * // Run benchmark...
 * 
 * auto spinningScheduler = std::make_unique<SpinningDirectScheduler>(config);
 * WorkService spinningService(config, std::move(spinningScheduler));
 * // Run same benchmark...
 * 
 * // The difference in execution time = thread wake overhead
 * @endcode

 * @brief Interface for thread pool providers that execute work from contract groups
 *
 * This file defines the IConcurrencyProvider interface, which provides the communication
 * protocol between WorkContractGroups and their execution providers (like WorkService).
 * It enables efficient thread wake-up and lifecycle management without creating tight
 * coupling between the scheduling and execution layers.

/**
 * @brief Interface for concurrency providers that execute work from WorkContractGroups
 *
 * This interface allows WorkContractGroups to notify their associated concurrency
 * provider (like WorkService) when work becomes available, enabling efficient
 * wake-up of waiting threads without creating direct dependencies.
 *
 * Implementers of this interface are responsible for executing work from the
 * groups they manage, and groups will call these methods to provide hints about
 * work availability.
 *
 * The key insight here is the inversion of control: instead of providers polling
 * groups for work (inefficient), groups push notifications when work arrives.
 * This enables sleeping threads to wake immediately when work is available, rather
 * than spinning or using fixed sleep intervals.
 *
 * Common implementations:
 * - WorkService: The main thread pool that manages multiple groups
 * - SingleThreadedProvider: Executes work on a dedicated thread (testing)
 * - ImmediateProvider: Executes work synchronously (debugging)
 *
 * Thread safety: All methods must be thread-safe as they may be called concurrently
 * from multiple WorkContractGroups.
 *
 * @code
 * // Implementing a custom provider
 * class MyProvider : public IConcurrencyProvider {
 *     std::condition_variable cv;
 *     std::mutex mutex;
 *
 *     void notifyWorkAvailable(WorkContractGroup* group) override {
 *         std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mutex);
 *         cv.notify_one(); // Wake a thread to check for work
 *     }
 *
 *     void notifyGroupDestroyed(WorkContractGroup* group) override {
 *         // Remove from internal group list
 *         removeGroup(group);
 *     }
 * };

/**
 * @brief The chaos monkey of schedulers - picks groups at random.
 * 
 * Sometimes the best strategy is no strategy. This scheduler just rolls the dice
 * and picks a random group that has work. It's surprisingly effective at avoiding
 * certain pathological patterns that can emerge with deterministic schedulers.
 * 
 * This scheduler uses a Mersenne Twister random number generator for
 * quality randomization.
 * 
 * The Good:
 * - Natural load balancing - randomness spreads work evenly over time
 * - Breaks up contention patterns - threads won't fight over the same groups
 * - Simple implementation - no state to maintain or update
 * - Each thread has its own RNG - no synchronization needed
 * 
 * The Not-So-Good:
 * - Zero cache locality - threads jump randomly between groups
 * - RNG computation cost
 * - Unpredictable execution order
 * - Might pick the same empty groups repeatedly (bad luck)
 * 
 * When to use this:
 * - You're seeing contention with deterministic schedulers
 * - Work distribution is unpredictable or bursty
 * - You want to test if scheduling order affects your results
 * - Cache locality doesn't matter for your workload
 * 
 * When NOT to use this:
 * - You need predictable, reproducible execution
 * - Cache performance is critical
 * - You have groups with vastly different work amounts
 * 
 * Fun fact: Uses reservoir sampling to ensure uniform selection among groups
 * with work. Every eligible group has equal probability of being chosen.
 * 
 * @code
 * // Random scheduling can help with "thundering herd" problems
 * // where all threads hit the same group at once
 * auto scheduler = std::make_unique<RandomScheduler>(config);
 * WorkService service(wsConfig, std::move(scheduler));
 * 
 * // Now threads naturally spread out across groups
 * @endcode

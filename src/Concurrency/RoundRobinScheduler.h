/**
 * @brief Fair round-robin scheduler providing uniform work distribution
 * 
 * RoundRobinScheduler implements a simple circular scheduling strategy where each
 * thread cycles through work groups in sequential order. Upon reaching the last
 * group, the scheduler wraps back to the first, ensuring equal opportunity for
 * all groups. This approach prioritizes fairness and simplicity over adaptive
 * optimization.
 * 
 * 
 * Advantages:
 * - Simple implementation facilitates understanding and debugging
 * - Provides perfect fairness with equal execution opportunities
 * - No complex calculations or state management
 * - Zero contention through thread-local counter implementation
 * 
 * Limitations:
 * - No empty group detection (cycles through all groups regardless of work availability)
 * - Disregards cache locality (threads alternate between groups)
 * - Cannot adapt to workload imbalances (uniform treatment of all groups)
 * 
 * Recommended use cases:
 * - Workloads with similar work distribution across groups
 * - Systems requiring predictable, deterministic scheduling behavior
 * - Debugging scenarios where scheduler variability must be eliminated
 * - Applications prioritizing fairness over throughput
 * 
 * Not recommended when:
 * - Significant work imbalances exist between groups
 * - Work arrives in bursts to specific groups
 * - Cache locality is important
 * 
 * @code
 * // Perfect for evenly distributed work
 * for (auto& group : groups) {
 *     for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
 *         auto handle = group->createContract(work);
 *         handle.schedule();
 *     }
 * }
 * 
 * // Use round-robin for predictable execution
 * auto scheduler = std::make_unique<RoundRobinScheduler>(config);
 * WorkService service(wsConfig, std::move(scheduler));
 * @endcode
